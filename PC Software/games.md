## General torrent

**NOTE: Some of these sites have fake and mirror sites, you should only use the ones we linked.**

**[1337x](https://1337x.to) (Torrent)**

A very popular torrenting site which has an incredible amount of content, but also has major downsides including a bad moderation team in general (not banning uploaders who have uploaded malware in the past) and an *incredibly* unsafe *Software* category.  
**_NOTE: Do not get software releases from this site. Stay away from torrents by IGGGAMES, xGIROx, Seyter, Qoob, nosTEAM and CorePack._**  

**[RARBG](https://rarbg.to) (Torrent)**

A very safe site to get games from, mostly scene releases which they have auto-uploading bots for. If you use a VPN, get ready to solve reCAPTCHAs.  
<sub>psst, check the misc page for captcha bypasses.</sub>

**[RuTor](http://rutor.info) (Torrent)**

An old russian tracker that has plenty of content but with generally less seeders. Some Repackers upload exclusively here.  
**_NOTE: Only get games from R.G. Mechanics, Chovka, XATAB and FitGirl_**.

## Repackers

**[FitGirl](https://fitgirl-repacks.site) (Torrent/DDL)**

One of the most well known and reputable repackers out there, very active and provides torrent links with DDL mirrors. Only downside being the repacks can take a long time to install depending on your hardware. Mostly uploads on 1337x.to, RuTor.info, Tapocheck.net and some DDL mirrors that will be linked on her site.

**[DODI](https://dodi-repacks.site) (Torrent/DDL)**

Another active repacker that provides torrent links with DDL mirrors. Usually takes less time to install compared to FitGirl, while having ever so slightly larger releases. Other than DDL mirrors on his site, he uploads on 1337x.

**[Masquerade](https://masquerade.site) (DDL/Torrent)**

A known repacker that focuses more on indie titles. Mostly uses Google Drive as the main downloading option and torrents on his newer releases.

**[XATAB](https://xatab-repack.com) (Torrent)**

One of the oldest and most respected repacker that passed away recently. His site is currently reposting from other sources but his older releases can still be found there. **RIP 196X - 2021.**

## General DDL

**[Ova Games](https://ovagames.com) (DDL)**

A site which focuses on re-uploading Repacks, P2P cracks, scene releases and GOG rips to various hosts. They rarely include Torrent links. They take requests.

**[CrackHub](https://crackhub.site) (DDL)**

Another site that mainly focuses on re-uploading to different hosts. They take requests too. It also has an automatic scene uploading bot which uploads to Zippyshare, found [here](https://scene.crackhub.site).

**[GamesDrive](https://gamesdrive.net) (DDL)**

Another site that re-uploads repacks, P2P cracks and scene releases to various hosts. They also take requests.

## Forums

**[CS.RIN.RU](https://cs.rin.ru/forum) (DDL)**

Arguably the best site for Steam piracy. It's a well moderated forum with active members. Not only good for getting games from, but also learning about different cracking tools for Steam Games. **_Requires sign-up_**.

**[Torrminatorr](https://forum.torrminatorr.com) (DDL)**

Another well moderated forum with active uploaders and discussions that allow scene uploads (contrary of CS.RIN.RU), GOG rips, retro games and even Linux games. **_Requires sign-up_**.

## Misc

**[Online-Fix](https://online-fix.me) (DDL/Torrent)**

Any cracked game that has multiplayer unlocked (usually on Steam) you will most likely find it here done by their own internal cracker, 0xdeadc0de.  
**_NOTE: Their site has strong measures against ad-blockers. Requires sign-up._**  

**[GOG Games](https://gog-games.com) (DDL)**

Every GOG DRM-free game, ripped and re-uploaded on mirrors. Every installer is untouched and has a cryptographic SHA-265 key from GOG.  

**[My Abandonware](https://myabandonware.com) (DDL)**

Offers downloads for old titles and hard to find abandonware games, including everything they came with.

**[F95zone](https://f95zone.to/) & [U18-Chan](https://u18chan.com/a/) (DDL)**

Big forums for **_adult games_**. U18-Chan focuses more on **_Yiff games_** while F95zone mainly focuses on **_Eroges_**. **_They both require you to sign up_**.

**[Nyaa](https://nyaa.si) & [Sukebei](https://sukebei.nyaa.si) (Torrent)**

Both are good sources for popular visual novels and Japanese games while the latter is more for **_NSFW titles_**.  

**[Lewd Patcher](https://lewdpatcher.com) (DDL)**

Has many different **_uncensored_** and **_lewd_** patches for games, which can be applied as a mod.

> **DDL:** Direct download, where you can download a file from a server usually done through your browser.
>
> **Torrent:** A decentralised peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that is very common when sharing pirated content, since the file isn't on a single server that can easily be taken down. We recommend using [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) as a BitTorrent client.
>
> **Repacks:** Highly compressed games that usually include all released DLCs, language packs, are pre-cracked and require minimal piracy knowledge. Good for beginners and people who have limited internet bandwidth.
>
> **Mirrors:** An alternate download link for the same file, similar to a DDL, but hosted in different places. If one mirror goes down, you can download the file from another mirror
